# community-patchers

Since `score-compose` version [`0.27.0`](https://github.com/score-spec/score-compose/releases/tag/0.27.0) and `score-k8s` version [`0.4.0`](https://github.com/score-spec/score-k8s/releases/tag/0.4.0), as Platform Engineers you can patch the default Workload manifests generated by `score-compose|k8s generate`. Seemlessly for your Developers, by using `score-compose|k8s init --patch-templates`.

This repository is a library of patch templates examples that you can use with either `score-compose` or `score-k8s`.
