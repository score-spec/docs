## Docs

This section covers how to build the documentation site with Hugo.
For information on Score's style guide see the [Style guide](styles/style-guide.md).

### Running the website locally

We use `yarn` (for MacOS: `brew install yarn`) as a package manager to ensure the versions of Hugo and associated tools are up to date. All commands that execute those tools are prefixed with `yarn run` or are aliased in the `package.json` file.

To install the packages:

```
yarn install
```

To run the server locally:

```
yarn build

OR

yarn run hugo server
```

And then view it at <http://localhost:1313>.

### Deployment

This site is currently deployed through Github Pages with a CNAME directing `docs.score.dev` to `score-spec.github.io`. The DNS configuration is managed by Humanitec.

### Format docs

The following section covers how to format and lint prose.

### Formatters and linters

This project uses the [dprint](https://dprint.dev/overview/) to format documentation. dprint is a command line application that automatically formats code.

Use `dprint` to format your documentation.

```bash
yarn fmt
```

Example output.

```bash
$ yarn fmt
Formatted 1 file.
✨  Done in 0.13s.
```

This project uses the [Vale](https://vale.sh) with a [Vale-compatible implementation of the Google Developer Documentation Style Guide](https://github.com/errata-ai/Google).

On MacOS, install it through `brew install vale`.

For example, to lint a document run:

```bash
vale sync
vale styles/style-guide.md
```

Example output.

```bash
 styles/style-guide.md
 40:71  error  Did you really mean             Vale.Spelling 
               'inclusivity'?                                

✖ 1 error, 0 warnings and 0 suggestions in 1 file.
```

To lint all documents, run `yarn lint`.

## Troubleshooting documentation site builds

This section covers common build issues with Hugo.

### Failed to resolve output format `print`

When building the server, you may receive the following error message.

```bash
Error: from config: failed to resolve output format "print" from site config
error Command failed with exit code 255.
info Visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/run for documentation about this command.
```

To resolve this issue, delete the temporary Hugo cache directory. By default, [`-cacheDir`](https://gohugo.io/commands/hugo_server/) is stored at `$TMPDIR/hugo_cache`.

```bash
rm -rf $TMPDIR/hugo_cache
```

### `package-lock.json` locked files

When running `yarn`, you may receive the following error message.

```bash
warning package-lock.json found. Your project contains lock files generated by tools other than Yarn. It is advised not to mix package managers in order to avoid resolution inconsistencies caused by unsynchronized lock files. To clear this warning, remove package-lock.json.
```

To resolve this issue, delete the `package-lock.json` file.

```bash
rm package-lock.json
```
