A _Workload_ is a deployable application made up of one or more containers that runs in the same context and share resources, dependencies and networks.

The Workload is a specification of how the containers should be run. For example, it might be run as a long-lived process, such as a microservice or application, or short-lived on demand, such as a cron job. You may prefer to think of Workloads as applications, programs, or processes if compared to non-cloud setups that run on a host or a virtual machine.
