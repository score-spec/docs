A _container_ is a ready-to-run software package that bundles up an application’s code together with any runtime it requires: system tools, libraries, and default values for any essential settings.

Containers are created from read-only templates called an _image_. Images are immutable by design. If the application code or default configuration changes, a new container image is needed to build.
