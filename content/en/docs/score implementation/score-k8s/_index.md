The `score-k8s` CLI serves as a reference implementation for the Score specification, providing a standard for the creation of custom Score CLIs. `score-k8s` can be utilized both as a reference point for implementation and for practical use in development with Kubernetes.

For additional details and opportunities to contribute to the project, visit the [`score-k8s`](https://github.com/score-spec/score-k8s) GitHub repository.
