# Overview

The `score-compose` serves as a reference implementation for the Score specification, providing a standard for the creation of custom Score CLIs. `score-compose` can be utilized both as a reference point for implementation and for practical use in local development with Docker Compose.

For additional details and opportunities to contribute to the project, visit the [`score-compose`](https://github.com/score-spec/score-compose) GitHub repository.
