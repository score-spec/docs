## Contribute examples to the community

Do you have a score examples that demonstrates a use-case or product integration that will help someone learn about score?

Beyond the official documentation there are endless possibilities for combining tools, platforms, languages, and products. By submitting a tutorial you can share your experience and help others who are solving similar problems.

Community tutorials are stored in examples
[`score-examples`](https://docs.score.dev/examples/).
These documents are contributed, reviewed, and maintained by the community.

Submit a Pull Request to the [`score-docs`](https://github.com/score-spec/docs) directory under the examples folder that aligns with your document. A reviewer will be assigned to review your submission. Theyâ€™ll work with you to ensure that your submission is clear, correct, and meets the style guide, but it helps if you follow it as you write your tutorial.
